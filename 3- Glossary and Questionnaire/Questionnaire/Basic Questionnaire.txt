1- What are diffusion models?

Ans- Diffusion models are a type of generative model that create data, like images, by iteratively refining random noise until a final output is produced.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

2- How do diffusion models differ from other generative models?

Ans- Diffusion models use an iterative process that gradually refines noise to generate data, unlike other generative models that may use more direct methods.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

3- What is the main idea behind the diffusion process in diffusion models?

Ans- The diffusion process starts with random noise and iteratively denoises it in small steps to generate a coherent output.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

4- What is the role of noise in training a diffusion model?

Ans- Noise is added to images during training so the model can learn to effectively denoise images at various levels of noise.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

5- How do you generate new images using a trained diffusion model?

Ans- New images are generated by starting with random noise and iteratively feeding it through the model to refine it into the final image.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

6- What are the key steps involved in training a diffusion model?

Ans- Key steps include loading images, adding noise, feeding noisy images into the model, evaluating denoising performance, and updating model weights.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

7- What is the significance of iterative updates in diffusion models?

Ans- Iterative updates allow the model to progressively improve its output, correcting errors made in early stages.

21- How does the DDPMScheduler add noise to images?

Ans- By following a predefined noise schedule across multiple timesteps during training.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

22- What are the steps in training a diffusion model from scratch?

Ans- Load data, add noise, feed noisy images into the model, evaluate denoising, update model weights, and repeat.

25- How can you upload a trained model to the Hugging Face Hub?

Ans- By using Git-LFS and the Hugging Face CLI to push the model's weights and configuration to the Hub.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

26- Why is Git-LFS required for uploading model checkpoints?

Ans- To efficiently manage and store large model files in a Git repository.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

27- What is the corruption process in the context of diffusion models?

Ans- The corruption process involves adding noise to the data, where the noise amount can be controlled to vary the level of corruption.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

28- How is noise added to data in a diffusion model?

Ans- Noise is added by mixing the input data with random noise, using a weighted sum controlled by a noise parameter.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

29- What is a UNet and why is it used in this example?

Ans- A UNet is a neural network architecture with a symmetric structure of downsampling and upsampling layers, used here to predict clean images from noisy inputs.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

30- How does the BasicUNet implementation differ from a full-scale UNet?

Ans- The BasicUNet in this example is a minimal implementation, using simple convolutional layers and max pooling for downsampling, and it lacks the complexity of a full-scale UNet.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

31- What is the purpose of skip connections in a UNet?

Ans- Skip connections help retain and transfer information from earlier layers directly to later layers, aiding in better reconstruction during upsampling.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

32- How does the UNet predict the original image from corrupted input?

Ans- The UNet processes the corrupted input through its layers and outputs a prediction that aims to approximate the original clean image.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

33- What loss function is used in the training of the BasicUNet, and why?

Ans- Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to measure the difference between the predicted and original images, guiding the network to reduce this error during training.
