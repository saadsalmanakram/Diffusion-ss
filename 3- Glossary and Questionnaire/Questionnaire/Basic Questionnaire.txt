1- What are diffusion models?

Ans- Diffusion models are a type of generative model that create data, like images, by iteratively refining random noise until a final output is produced.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

2- How do diffusion models differ from other generative models?

Ans- Diffusion models use an iterative process that gradually refines noise to generate data, unlike other generative models that may use more direct methods.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

3- What is the main idea behind the diffusion process in diffusion models?

Ans- The diffusion process starts with random noise and iteratively denoises it in small steps to generate a coherent output.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

4- What is the role of noise in training a diffusion model?

Ans- Noise is added to images during training so the model can learn to effectively denoise images at various levels of noise.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

5- How do you generate new images using a trained diffusion model?

Ans- New images are generated by starting with random noise and iteratively feeding it through the model to refine it into the final image.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

6- What are the key steps involved in training a diffusion model?

Ans- Key steps include loading images, adding noise, feeding noisy images into the model, evaluating denoising performance, and updating model weights.

7- What is the significance of iterative updates in diffusion models?

Ans- Iterative updates allow the model to progressively improve its output, correcting errors made in early stages.
